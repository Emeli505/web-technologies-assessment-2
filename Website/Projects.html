<h1> My projects </h1>
<p> One of the projects that i have taken on in my course is Software Development. With Software Development i was tasked and challenged to understand and learn how to develop software solutions making use of different tools and approaches. i had to learn the basic concepts of programming such as conditions, loops, functions and variables. i had to also learn about software versioning which required me to use a website called GitHub. This enabled me to build software and also be able to track the changes made to my code overtime.Not only that, but i had the opportuninty to write and excute python code directly to my browser. this made me really confident as this website was suitable for beginners like myself to practice programming without a complex setup. i also had the chance to create a task management system for users to use to add, delete, view and update tasks in there to do list. </p>
